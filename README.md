# John.ly V2

I created this out of necessity.  I wasn't happy with any of the existing themes on the market (free or paid).

This is my third attempt at a ghost theme. I'm much happier with this version, and feel confident it'll serve someone else well here on GitHub.

## License and Usage

I don't care if you use this code. Keep in mind I made this for my use only at [john.ly](//john.ly). What that means is:
* Do not file any PRs or Issues. I don't care about either. 
* No support. I posted this here in hopes it'll help someone. If you can't figure it out or want to tweak it but need help, you're on your own.
